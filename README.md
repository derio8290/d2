# Mini entry system

Open `index.html` in a browser. It shows "Do you want to enter?" with Yes and No links.
Clicking **Yes** opens `yes.html` which displays "I love you." Clicking **No** opens
`no.html` with a message "Maybe next time!".

New page `click.html` provides a button labeled "click me" that opens `empty.html`, which has no content.
